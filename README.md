# Reinforcement-learning
Testing different RL algorithms were tested in the city learn environment.

Algorithms:
  Pytorch implementation of PPO in env-pendulum v0- test code.

Cont spaces:
  Implementation of PPO in cont state and action spaces
  
    -file to be run : ppo_citylearn.ipynb

Discrete spaces:
  Implementation of SARSA and Q-Learning in discrete state and action spaces
 
    -file to be run : SARSA_QL.ipynb
  
Modified reward functions:
  Different modifications of the reward fucntion were  before arriving at the final formulation.
  
  Modified reward functions has the different reward functions that were tried.
  new reward fucntion with toy data has the final reward fucntion we arrived at, instances it was tested in, and it's test in           city learn environment.

Other policy gradient algo
   Implementation of reinforce with baseline and one step actor critic (with and without eligibility traces).
